Description: 
    SpotClean is a computational method to adjust for spot swapping in spatial 
    transcriptomics data. Recent spatial transcriptomics experiments utilize 
    slides containing thousands of spots with spot-specific barcodes that bind 
    mRNA. Ideally, unique molecular identifiers at a spot measure spot-specific 
    expression, but this is often not the case due to bleed from nearby spots, 
    an artifact we refer to as spot swapping. SpotClean is able to estimate the 
    contamination rate in observed data and decontaminate the spot swapping 
    effect, thus increase the sensitivity and precision of downstream analyses.
